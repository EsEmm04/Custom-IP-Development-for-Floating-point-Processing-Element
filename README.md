# Custom-IP-Development-for-Floating-point-Processing-Element
Developed and wrapped IP for a Floating Point Processing Element that was created under ICHIP'24 (Verilog based Event)which 

The two files DUTPE.v is the design of problem statement which you can refer above where as TBPE.v is the test bench to test the design. For more clarity about how the solution was proposed please refer the approach pdf provided. 

After the Event I have generated IP for this processing element using Vivado and vitis for validation. I have provided the HDL Wrapper that is generated and test code on vitis.
